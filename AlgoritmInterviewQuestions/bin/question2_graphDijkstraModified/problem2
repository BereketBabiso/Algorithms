Given an undirected weighted graph. The task is to find the minimum cost of the path from source node to the destination node via an intermediate node.

Note: If an edge is traveled twice, only once weight is calculated as cost.

<0>----1-----<1>-----2-----<2>
              |
              |
              |
              3
              |
              |
             <3>

Input: source = 0, destination = 2, intermediate = 3;
Output: 6
The minimum cost path 0->1->3->1->2
The edge (1-3) occurs twice in the path, but its weight is
added only once to the answer.

Input: source = 0, destination = 2, intermediate = 1;
Output: 3
The minimum cost path is 0->1>2
